# Reactjs-SSR-Demo

_SSR with all the goodies, without ejecting._

## Installation

1.  Install dependencies via `yarn install`
2.  To run locally, use `yarn start`
3.  To run under SSR mode, use `yarn build && yarn serve`

## Why?

Server-side rendering is a requirement for many modern web applications to appear correctly in search engines and social media parsers.
